# MegaMan1NESRecomp

The Europe ROM has an opt-in [experimental adaptive widescreen mod](WIDESCREEN.md).
It is disabled by default and has known margin-combat and scene-transition limits.
The normal USA build does not enroll the Europe-specific hooks.

## Cycle backend migration branch

Default cycle controls: arrows move, Z is A, X is B, Enter is Start and
Backslash is Select. Escape opens the menu, Tab fast-forwards, and F8/F9
save/load the cycle state. Use Controls to remap inputs in `config.ini`.
Older `keybinds.ini` and F5/F6/F7 instructions below apply to the legacy host.

The normal build now uses the cycle CPU backend. Code is generated from the
original ROM during configure and stays in the build directory. Run `setup.bat`
or `setup.sh` to initialize the pinned engine/UI submodules, then configure:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-cycle -DNESRECOMP_ROM="/path/to/Game.nes"
cmake --build build-cycle --config Release --parallel 4
```

Run the executable with that same ROM path. The launcher verifies the image;
the runtime also verifies cartridge metadata and PRG identity. `NESRECOMP_ROOT`
and `NESRECOMP_RECOMP_UI` can name other checkouts, and cross builds accept
`NESRECOMP_HOST_COMPILER` pointing to a runnable host compiler.

Keep the old generated sources and select them explicitly with
`-DNESRECOMP_BACKEND=legacy` in a separate build directory. Legacy save states
cannot be loaded by the cycle backend; its cartridge shortcut slot uses
`saves/<ROM stem>.cycstate`. Preserve existing saves and settings during rollout.
Cycle-native comparisons use `nesrecomp/tools/cyc/cyc_verify.py`; `--interp-only`
runs the cycle interpreter for diagnosis. Earlier `--verify` / `--emulated`
Nestopia entry points remain in the legacy build.

Desktop Windows checks cover short gameplay routes and runtime
menu/input/save-state behavior. Other platforms and full-game completion
remain outside this validation.

Cycle Windows builds use `tools/build.ps1 -Rom <original-ROM>`. Create a ROM-free
ZIP with `tools/make_release.ps1 -Rom <original-ROM>`; `-SkipBuild -BuildDir
build-cycle` packages an existing production cycle build. Legacy C remains
available through explicit CMake selection.
